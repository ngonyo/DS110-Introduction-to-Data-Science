# This branch contains the files from the first project of DS110 which was focused on classification. 
# The pdf is the most useful file as it is a general overview / paper of the work we did in R, including R outputs and graphs. 
# The R files included are the cluster analysis itself, as well as the general project file. The last R file is the post analysis plots (using ggplot2) which are shown in the pdf.
