This branch contains the files from the first project of DS110 which was focused on classification. The pdf is the most useful file as it is a general overview / paper of the work we did in R, including R outputs and graphs.
The original dataset, as well as the group specific (randomly generated subset from original dataset), train, and test datasets are also included.
The R file which contains the work I did for the project in R. This does not include the entirety of the project as parts were done by different members in their own R files.
